## JetBrains IDEs

This will communicate with any JetBrains IDE running the
[Stream Deck](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22441-stream-deck) plugin.
Action IDs can be found from Settings > Tools > Stream Deck > Action Id Browser, and a lookup is available
[in the IDE plugin's repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-streamdeck-plugin/blob/main/IDEA_actions.md).

### Actions

There are two types of actions:
 - Run action without configuration: for most actions that don't have any run configuration associated
 - Run action with configuration: for Run, Debug, Profile, and similar actions that can take a run configuration as a parameter

### Icons

JetBrains has [an icon lookup](https://intellij-icons.jetbrains.design), but PNG icons are also available in a
[community-created repository](https://git.steffann.nl/sander/streamdeck-intellij-icons).
